# Denver Demographic Study

## Background and Motivation 

I am a newcomer to Denver, moved here from California at the beginning of 2019.  We are drawn to Colorado by its natural beauty, the diverse culture presence, abundant art and music scenes, and fast growing high-tech industry. 

I have read that City of Denver has changed significantly in the past 10-15 years.  There are many angles to view these changes.  In this study, I would like to focus on studying the changes from the demographic compositions, specifically:

* Income distirbution over time, to see if certain geographic areas has morphed into new "hot spots" when redevelopments happen. 
* Has the median age of the city changed significantly as more people immigrate to Denver?  That is, is the city growing "younger" on average? 
* As more people immigrate to Denver, which geographic locations observed the most increase in school age children?  
* House ownership, to see if the ownership decreases over time as the local real estate market gets "hotter" and gradually "out-of-reach"?

## Data

I found the American Community Survey (ACS) data at the U.S. census block group level on the [Denver Open Data Catalog.](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata)  The United States Census Bureau generates the ACS data.  

U.S. Census Bureau conducts comprehensive household surveys every 10 years.  This year (2020) is a census year.  Census blocks are introduced in 1990, and they are the smallest statistical units for which surveys are conducted.  Census blocks are by design small in area and typically bounded by streets in the city and natural landmarks in the suburbs and rural areas.  In more remote areas, census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles.  In total, there are approximately 8,200,000 blocks in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. 

The census block group lies above the census blocks.  There are roughly 39 blocks per each census group, with each block group generally containing between 600 to 3,000 people.   There are 211,267 block groups in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. In the 2000 census, Census tracts are introduced as the tier above block group.  Census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population compsitions, social and economic conditions, and living status.  Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people.  In this study, we rely on data at the census block group level.  It is the smallest geographical unit for which the Bureau publishes sample data.     

During each 10-year interval, the Bureau contacts 3.5 million households across the country to participate in the annual ACS survey.  The data is then compiled and published as 5-year averages.  The most recent ACS data for the City and County of Denver that I was able to locate is the 2014-2018 average, published on Feb 6, 2020.
